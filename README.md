## Purpose:

User can navigate to the dropdown menu and select an European city/country. The website will display the day's weather info of the selected city/country

## Description:

The code creates a simple weather website by fetching city data, generating a dropdown menu, retrieving weather information from an API using selected city coordinates, and displaying the results on the page. It mostly uses vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap for a simple, responsive user interface.

## Limitations:

Unfortunately, the API seems to be outdated and does not provide weather information for 7 days, even with the correct parameters. As a result, I was only able to display the weather information for only a single day. 

If the user selects another city or country after the first one, the data is added to the original instead of replacing it.

## Potential Improvements:

1. Bug fixes
2. Display weather data of selected region over 7 days using a more up-to date API
3. Improve UI
